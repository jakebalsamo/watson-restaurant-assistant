# Watson Restaurant Assistant
This assistant is designed to make everybody's life easier when planning a dinner or order from a restaurant! This particular assistant handles reservations, orders, and questions about a specific restaurant known as Truck Stop Gourmand. The inclusion of artifical intelligence in customer service is growing exponentially; this is due to it's use case being so incredibly applicable. When the majority of customer questions and uniform actions are caught in the net of an automated yet intelligent voice assistant, the workload of the humans at the company/restaurant are lessened. When the voice assistant provides a reliable, accurate information and never responds with disinterest or negative intentions, the customer is happier. The benefits greatly outweigh the consequences when considering implementing voice assistants into the customer service environment. 

The Restaurant Assistant is powered by the IBM Watson Assistant, using predetermined human intents and dialog paths, in addition to machine learning to improve its accuracy and effectiveness in conversation.
